    <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>

    <p>
      Hey Hey! My name is Elora. Online I usually go by TuPu (short for "theurbanpinup") and I'm a retro loving illustrator & animator from London.
    </p>


    <p>
      I absolutely adore "doodling" (as I like to call it) and it is something I've done for as far back as I can remember. My art takes a lot of influence from the things I grew up with such as anime, Golden Age Animation and dolls (yep, I'm a 90's baby alright!) Over the years, these elements have all fused together resulting in my own lil' style.
    </p>


    <p>
      When I'm not drawing I can be found making cute clay figures or dabbling in resin art along with other "hands on" art crafts.
    </p>

    <p>
    This year I really hope to build and create a lot more for all you guys so without further ado&colon; 
    <br> 
    Welcome to the world of TuPu Art - I hope you enjoy what I create.
    </p>
