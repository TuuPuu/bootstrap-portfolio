# ELORA AINOA BOOTSTRAP PORTFOLIO

## A working portfolio to showcase Elora Ainoa's FrontEnd Development journey built with Bootstrap



## SUMMARY

My main goal was to build a portfolio webpage from scratch, using Bootstrap Framework.
I aimed to implement basic CSS styling principles using Bootstrap as well as page responsiveness.
Links are required to link down to corresponding areas on webpage
From a developer perspective, I aimed to create clear and concise code that could easily be refactored in future.
